  <title>A short history of Extbase and Fluid</title>

  <para>After the implementation of TYPO3 v5 and FLOW3 as the basis framework
  started, the development of TYPO3 v4 and TYPO3 v5 was happening almost
  completely independent from each other. In October 2008, the core developers
  of both branches met for the <emphasis>TYPO3 Transition Days</emphasis> in
  Berlin. There, the developers wanted to work on a common vision and strategy
  for the transition from the current TYPO3 version 4 to the coming version 5.
  The core points of this strategy were communicated as a manifesto (see the
  box "The Berlin Manifesto").</para>

  <para>With the background of this manifesto, the decision was made to
  re-implement two parts of TYPO3 v4:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>A modern successor for the base class
      <classname>tslib_piBase</classname>, on which by now the majority of the
      3600 extensions for TYPO3 builds on. From there, Extbase emerged.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>A new template engine for outputting data, which connects
      flexibility, ease of use and extensibility: Fluid.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Discussions about the new template engine started already on the
  Transition Days, where Bastian Waidelich and Sebastian Kurfürst discussed
  how such a new template engine should work and behave. Shortly after, a
  prototype was implemented. The development of Extbase began two months
  later, when a few core members met in Karlsruhe. There, they agreed on
  staying as close as possible to the concepts, the architecture and the APIs
  of FLOW3.</para>

  <para>After that followed an intensive development phase, where Jochen Rau
  developed the biggest part of Extbase, while Sebastian Kurfürst did code
  reviews and gave feedback. Additionally, Fluid has reached the beta stage in
  that time.</para>

  <para>The first public presentation of Extbase happened in March 2009 at the
  <emphasis>T3BOARD09</emphasis> in Laax (CH). With stormy weather, 2228 m
  over sea level, core developers and interested people could see the current
  state of Extbase. In a stimulated discussion<remark>TODO: sounds
  strange</remark>, the last open topics like naming conventions or the name
  of the framework, were decided upon. Additionally, the decision was made to
  include Fluid in version 4.3, instead in version 4.4 as planned
  before.</para>

  <para>In the following days, the Fluid team developed a small program (named
  <emphasis>Backporter</emphasis>) which could take the code of Fluid for
  FLOW3, and transform it to code for TYPO3 v4. That's how the first working
  version of Fluid vor TYPO3 v4 came into being at the end of the T3BOARD09.
  Additionally, it was now pretty easy to keep Fluid for FLOW3 in sync with
  Fluid for TYPO3 v4.</para>

  <para>The first real presentation of Extbase and Fluid happened in April
  2009 on the american <emphasis>TYPO3 Conference</emphasis> in Dallas, and a
  month later on the <emphasis>TYPO3 Developer Days</emphasis> in Elmshorn
  near Hamburg. After that, a lot of positive feedback and constructive
  criticism emerged from the community.</para>

  <para>During the next months, a lot of work was done to clean up the
  details: The syntax of Fluid was improved, ViewHelpers were written, and the
  persistence layer of Extbase was improved and refactored multiple times.
  Functionalities for the security of the framework were implemented, the MVC
  framework was cleaned up, and more functionalities were implemented which
  were needed for practical usage.</para>

  <para>At the <emphasis>T3CON09</emphasis> in autumn 2009, Extbase and Fluid
  could be presented as a beta version. Afterwards, only errors were
  corrected, but no new functionalities were implemented. With the release of
  TYPO3 4.3.0 in November 2009, Extbase and Fluid were included in the TYPO3
  core and are thus available in every TYPO3 installation.</para>

  <para>After a well-deserved break of the development team after the release,
  work started again with smaller bugfixes and a roadmap for upcoming
  functionalities. That's how many details of the framework were improved, and
  the persistence layer was once again streamlined and cleaned up.</para>
