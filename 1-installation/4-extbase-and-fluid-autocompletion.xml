  <title>Extbase and Fluid Autocompletion</title>

  <para>When developing your own Extensions you'll often work with classes of
  Extbase and Fluid. That's why it helps to set up the autocompletion feature.
  It will enable suggestions for complete class names as soon as you press
  Ctrl + Space (see fig. 1-2). To activate this functionality you have to
  configure the project you're currently developing, making it depend on
  Extbase and Fluid. After that the IDE will activate autocompletion for
  Extbase and Fluid classes.</para>

  <para><remark>TODO: Insert figure 1-2 with caption: The autocompletion
  feature will show you possible class names and their code
  documentation.</remark></para>

  <para>In NetBeans right-click your Extension project and choose
  <emphasis>Properties</emphasis> in the opened context menu to edit the
  project properties. Select the category <emphasis>PHP Include
  Path</emphasis> and use <emphasis>Add Folder...</emphasis> to add the
  directories of Extbase and Fluid.</para>

  <para>In Eclipse this works pretty similar. Right-click the project in which
  you want to enable the autocompletion feature and select
  <emphasis>Properties</emphasis>. Now choose the category <emphasis>PHP
  include Path</emphasis>. Now click on <emphasis>Projects</emphasis>, because
  you want to create a reference to another Eclipse project. Click on the
  <emphasis>Add...</emphasis> button and choose the Extbase and Fluid Projects
  that you've created before.</para>
