  <title>Installation</title>

  <para>In this chapter we want to help you to set up an effecient working
  environment. There are some notes how to set up the development server to
  start with. After that there will be an explanation how to install the two
  TYPO3 Extensions <emphasis>extbase</emphasis> and <emphasis>fluid</emphasis> which this book is about. Furthermore we
  will give you some recommendations how set up your development environment
  (IDE), to have code completion und the IDE integrated Debugger right at your
  hand. A list of some more TYPO3 Extensions that might be helpful to you,
  will round up this chapter - including information from which sources to get
  them.</para>
