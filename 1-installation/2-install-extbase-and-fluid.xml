  <title>Install Extbase and Fluid</title>

  <para>Since TYPO3 version 4.3 Extbase and Fluid are included into the TYPO3
  core as so called <emphasis>System Extensions</emphasis>. To install these,
  go to the Extension Manager and select <emphasis>Install
  Extensions</emphasis>. Click the little plus icon at the beginnings of the
  entries for the Extensions <emphasis>extbase</emphasis> and
  <emphasis>fluid</emphasis>. Afterwards -if neccessary- there will by a
  dialogue, adjusting the TYPO3 database a little, because Extbase will need a
  new database table to store cache informations.</para>

  <para>Now you have installed Extbase and Fluid and can use them for
  Extension development. To check if Extbase and Fluid are working, we will
  install a Blog Example Extension, which was created for testing Extbase and
  Fluid. We will have a closer look at this Extension in chapter 3.</para>

  <para>Again open the Extension Manager and open the submodule
  <emphasis>Import extensions</emphasis> this time. Click
  <emphasis>Retrieve/Update</emphasis> to download the current list of
  available Extensions. Now you can search for the Extension
  <emphasis>blog_example</emphasis>. With a click on the red arrow next to the
  result, you will start to download the Extension to your TYPO3 instance.
  After that you can click <emphasis>Install extension</emphasis> right away,
  to have it installed.</para>

  <para>After completing that, you'll find a new submodule
  <emphasis>Blogs</emphasis> inside the <emphasis>Web</emphasis> module. If
  you can't see it, you should reload the TYPO3 backend in your browser. With
  a click on <emphasis>Create example data</emphasis>, some dummy records will
  be created. The Blog Example is now working and can go on with Extbase and
  Fluid.</para>

  <para>The development of Extbase and Fluid proceeds quite fast. If you miss
  certain functionalities or experiencing an issue, you should install the
  development versions of Extbase and Fluid from the software versionining
  system Subversion. Open the <emphasis>typo3conf/ext/</emphasis> directory of
  your TYPO3 instance on the command line and get the development versions
  (called trunk) of Extbase and Fluid with the command line tool
  Subversion:</para>

  <para><code>svn checkout
  https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/CoreProjects/MVC/extbase/trunk
  extbase</code></para>

  <para><code>svn checkout
  https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/CoreProjects/MVC/fluid/trunk
  fluid</code></para>

  example.</remark></code></para>

      <para>If you find an issue in Extbase or Fluid, you should have a look
      at the development platform forge.typo3.org. These projects are

      wiki for the projects:</para>

      <para>Additionally there is a special newsgroup and mailing list, which
