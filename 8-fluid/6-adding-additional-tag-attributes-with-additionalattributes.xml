  <title>Adding additional tag attributes with additionalAttributes</title>

  <para>At the moment most of the ViewHelpers can be split into two types: One
  group of ViewHelpers is rather functional oriented. That applies for example
  to the <code>format</code> ViewHelpers, which can format data or currencies.
  The other group is mostly output oriented, because these ViewHelpers output
  mostly a HTML tag. Samples of this are the form ViewHelpers, all of them
  start with <code>f:form</code>. Every form ViewHelper generates a HTML tag,
  like e.g. <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.</para>

  <para>A Fluid ViewHelper supports most attributes that are also available in
  HTML. There are for example the attributes <code>class</code> and
  <code>id</code> which exists in all tag based ViewHelper. You find a listing
  of all universal properties in the appendix C.</para>

  <para>However, sometimes attributes are needed that are not provided by the
  ViewHelper - maybe a special JavaScript event handler or proprietary
  attributes (which are used by JavaScript frameworks like Dojo for example).
  To output them as well without changing the ViewHelper, the attribute
  <code>additionalAttributes</code> is available. This is an associative array
  by which additional tag attributes can be defined, like the following
  example shows:</para>

  <para><programlisting>&lt;f:form.textbox id="myTextbox" additionalAttributes="{onclick: 'alert(\'Hello World\')'}" /&gt;</programlisting></para>

  <para>The HTML tag generated by the ViewHelper now also supports the
  <code>onclick</code> attribute:</para>

  <para><programlisting>&lt;input type="text" onClick="alert('Hello World')" id="myTextbox" /&gt;</programlisting></para>

  <para>The <code>additionalAttributes</code> is especially helpful if only a
  few of this additional attributes are needed. Otherwise it is often
  reasonable to write an own ViewHelper which extends the corresponding
  ViewHelper.</para>

  <para><code>additionalAttributes</code> is provided by the
  <code>TagBasedViewHelper</code>, the base class for tag based ViewHelpers
  (see appendix C) and it allows the adding of optional attributes for the
  HTML tag output.</para>
