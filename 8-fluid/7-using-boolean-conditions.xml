  <title>Using boolean conditions</title>

  <para><emphasis>Boolean conditions</emphasis> are queries that compare two
  values with each other (e.g. with <code>==</code> or <code>&gt;=</code>) and
  then returns the value <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Which values
  are interpreted as <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> by Fluid depends
  on the data type. A number for example is evaluated as <code>true</code> if
  it is greater than 0.</para>

  <tip>
    <para>You find a complete list of all evaluating possibilities in appendix
    C in the section "Boolean expressions".</para>
  </tip>

  <para>With the help of conditions you can hide or show certain parts of a
  template. A typical scenario is the display of search results: If search
  results are found, they were displayed; if none results are found an
  appropriate message should be displayed. In Fluid the
  <code>IfViewHelper</code> enables such case-by-case analysis.</para>

  <para>Simple <code>if</code> queries (without an else term) looks like
  this:</para>

  <para><programlisting>&lt;f:if condition="{blog.posts}"&gt;
  This is only shown if blog posts are available.
&lt;/f:if&gt;</programlisting></para>

  <tip>
    <para>If none comparison operator like <code>==</code> is given, per
    default empty lists are interpreted as <code>false</code> and list with at
    least one element as <code>true</code>.</para>
  </tip>

  <para>Using the inline notation it looks like this:</para>

  <para><programlisting>&lt;div class="{f:if(condition: blog.posts, then: 'blogPostsAvailable')}"&gt;
  This div has the CSS class 'BlogPostAvailable', if blog posts are available.
&lt;/div&gt;</programlisting></para>

  <para>Also <code>if-then-else</code> structures are possible. In that case
  the <code>then</code> tag is required:</para>

  <para><programlisting>&lt;f:if condition="{blog.posts}"&gt;
  &lt;f:then&gt;
    This is only shown if blog posts are available.
  &lt;/f:then&gt;
  &lt;f:else&gt;
    No blog posts available.
  &lt;/f:else&gt;
&lt;/f:if&gt;</programlisting>This is also possible in the inline
  notation:</para>

  <para><programlisting>&lt;div class="{f:if(condition: blog.posts, then: 'blogPostsAvailable', else: 'noPosts')}"&gt;
  This div has the CSS class 'BlogPostAvailable', if blog posts are available.
  If no posts are available this div container gets the CSS class 'noPosts' assigned.
&lt;/div&gt;</programlisting></para>

    <title>Realize complex comparisons</title>

    <para>Until now we have employed with simplest boolean evaluations. With
    the syntax you have learned until now, no comparisons or modulo operations
    are possible. Fluid supports these conditions as well. Here is a short
    example:</para>

    <para><programlisting>&lt;f:if condition="{posts.viewCount} % 2"&gt;
  viewCount is an even number.
&lt;/f:if&gt;</programlisting>Note the enhanced syntax inside the condition.
    The compare operators <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>,
    <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>
    and <code>%</code> are available. The parameter left and right of the
    operators could be numbers, object accessors, arrays and ViewHelpers in
    inline notation, but not strings.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>Comparisons with strings, like <code>&lt;f:if condition="{gender}
      == 'male'"&gt;....&lt;/f:if&gt;</code>, are not possible with Fluid yet
      because of the complex implementation. If you need such a condition, you
      have to write a ViewHelper that returns the needed string. Then you can
      compare the object accessor with the output of the ViewHelper:</para>

      <para><code>&lt;f:if condition="{gender}" ==
      {my:male()}"&gt;...&lt;/f:if&gt;</code></para>
    </tip>

    <para>The just shown detailed notation for comparisons and modulo
    operations is not only available for the <code>if</code> ViewHelper but
    for all ViewHelpers which have a parameter of the type
    <code>boolean</code>.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>Once you develop an own ViewHelper - like described in the section
      "<xref linkend="Fluid_custom_viewHelper" />" later on in this chapter -
      you can use boolean expressions as arguments. Therefore the ViewHelper
      has to mark all arguments where those expressions are to be used as
      <code>boolean</code>. The just explained functionality is not only
      available in the <code>if</code> ViewHelper, but rather available in
      self developed ViewHelper.<remark> ??? Sentence is not very
      clear</remark></para>
    </tip>

    <para>Upon engaged with many functionalities for the author of templates
    in this section, we would show you now how to develop your own
    ViewHelper.<remark>??? Does anyone understand the first part of the
    sentence?</remark></para>
