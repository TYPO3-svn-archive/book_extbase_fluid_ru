  <title>Styling the output with Fluid</title>

  <para>Up to now you have learned how to represent the business logic of an
  application with a model and how to manipulate the model with the use of
  controllers. So far we have covered the output of data for the user only
  marginally. We want to take a closer look at this now. We will show you how
  you can create output for the user simple and fast. To make this work most
  efficient, specially for TYPO3 and FLOW3 a new templating engine named
  <emphasis>Fluid</emphasis> was developed, which is flexible and extensible,
  but easy to learn.</para>

  <para>In this chapter you will start with learning the basic concepts of
  Fluid. After that we will show you some functions which are helpful in
  templating with the help of various examples. Beside this we show you the
  development of a ViewHelper using an example. Finally we show you how you
  can apply the learned technologies with the help of a practical
  sample.</para>
