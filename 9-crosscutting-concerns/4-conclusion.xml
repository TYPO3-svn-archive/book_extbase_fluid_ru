  <title>Conclusion</title>

  <para>In this chapter we have considered tasks that touch several layer of
  the MVC achitecture. First we have seen how to cover extensions for multi
  languages by adjust static text in the templates and also country-specific
  formats like date or time are adjusted. In addition we have shown that also
  the domain model itself can be translated. After this we show the check of
  invariants in the model, inclusive thedisplay of error messages in the
  template and the possibility to correct wrong entries by the user. At last
  we have shown concepts that apply to the security of the extension.
  Importand by this is tha you have understand what are request hashes and how
  to prevent against cross site scripting.</para>

  <para>Now in the progrss of the book you have get to know Extbase and Fluid
  intensively. We should not get out of view that these technologies also are
  bridges to FLOW3 and TYPO3 version 5. The following chapter contains an
  outlook to FLOW3 and the ongoing development.</para>
