  <title>Internationalization, Validation and Security</title>

  <para>In the previous chapters we have examined all levels of the MVC
  pattern. Thereby we have cosidered every level seperately. This will change
  in this chapter: Here we will talk about functions on extension programming,
  where the interaction of the different levels is important. First we show
  how to programm Extbase based extensions which can create output in
  different languages. Besides the localisation of static text we also provide
  the translation of domain objects. In the second section of the chapter we
  explain how the consistency terms of the domain model are to be implemented
  and checked. This chapter will end with some aspects which enhance the
  security of the extension.</para>
