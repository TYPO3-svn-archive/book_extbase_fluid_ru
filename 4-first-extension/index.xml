  <title>Creating a first extension</title>

  <para>In this chapter you learn the basics of an extension based on extbase
  and fluid. You build up a minimalistic extension, which is reduced to the
  absolutely necessary structures. So you view clearly the whole, without
  hassles with details. In the following chapters we will turn to a more
  complex example, to cover exhaustively all fundamental attributes of extbase
  and fluid.</para>
