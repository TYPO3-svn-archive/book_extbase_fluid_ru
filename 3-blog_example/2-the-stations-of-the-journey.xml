  <title>The stations of the journey</title>

  <para>Now that you have had a look at your journey destination and hopefully
  don't feel disoriented when we stop at the several steps, you are now able
  to start. Figure 3-3 gives you an overview of the stations on the journey,
  which you will get to know more detailed in the upcoming sections.</para>

  <remark>TODO: Insert figure 3-3: The several stations of the
  journey</remark>

  <para>When an extension like the blog example is called, the following
  happens behind the scenes:</para>

  <para>TYPO3 digs into the page content and discovers the content element of
  the extension (plugin) on the page. It does not call the extension directly,
  but hands over the control to the Extbase <emphasis>Dispatcher</emphasis>
  (1).<remark>TODO: Add callouts</remark></para>

  <para>The <emphasis>Dispatcher</emphasis> bundles all information of the
  request in a <emphasis>Request</emphasis> and sends it to the responsible
  part of the extension, which takes over the flow control - the so called
  <emphasis>Controller</emphasis> (2).</para>

  <para>Within the controller the responsible storage room, which is in charge
  of the blogs, - the <emphasis>Repository</emphasis> - is instructed to
  return all the stored blogs using the method <code>findAll()</code>
  (3).</para>

  <para>The <emphasis>Repository</emphasis> returns a collection of the
  already made <code>Blog</code> objects with all of its posts, comments and
  tags (4).</para>

  <para>The <emphasis>Controller</emphasis> sends these blogs to the part of
  the extension responsible for the output - the <emphasis>View</emphasis> -
  and advises it to render the content in the requested output format
  (5).</para>

  <para>The <emphasis>View</emphasis> returns the rendered content
  encapsulated in a <emphasis>Response</emphasis> back to the
  <emphasis>Dispatcher</emphasis>, which on its turn returns the HTML code to
  the calling TYPO3 process (6).</para>
